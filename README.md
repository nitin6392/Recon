Installing

Ideally, you should be able to just type:

" apt update -y "
" apt upgrade -y "
" apt install wget python3 python3-pip git curl perl apache2 Recon festival "
" chmod +x recon.sh "
" bash recon.sh or ./recon.sh "

For far more in-depth compilation, installation, and removal notes, read the Recon Install Guide on recon.com.
Using Recon

Recon has a lot of features, but getting started is as easy as running Recon scanme.recon.com. Running Recon without any parameters will give a helpful list of the most common options, which are discussed in depth in the man page. Users who prefer a graphical interface can use the included ZeRecon front-end.
Contributing

Information about filing bug reports and contributing to the Recon project can be found in the HACKING and CONTRIBUTING.md files.
